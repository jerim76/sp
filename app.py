Conducted by therapists with 5+ years of experience, sessions use Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to reframe negative thoughts, Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) for emotional regulation, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) for value-based living, and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) for relaxation. Each 50-minute session is available in-person at our branches across Kenya or via secure video conferencing. We offer flexible scheduling (evenings, weekends) and a free 15-minute initial consultation to assess needs, match you with a therapist, and provide a personalized treatment plan, including progress reports every 5 sessions."

Facilitated by two counselors with 10+ years of group experience, these 90-minute weekly sessions accommodate up to 10 participants, ensuring personalized support. The program includes role-playing to practice social skills, peer support circles for shared experiences, guided meditations for stress relief, and monthly theme-based discussions (e.g., resilience, coping with loss), adjusted based on participant feedback.

Led by family therapists trained in systemic therapy (addressing family patterns) and narrative therapy (reframing family stories), these 60-minute sessions incorporate culturally-sensitive practices such as proverbs for wisdom, community elder mediation for resolution, and storytelling to heal relationships. Available in-person at our branches or via video calls, with a focus on long-term family wellness plans, including monthly check-ins and a 6-session initial program."
